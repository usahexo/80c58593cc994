        <h1 id="Houston-Texans-Look-to-Improve-Record-in-Division-Play"><a href="#Houston-Texans-Look-to-Improve-Record-in-Division-Play" class="headerlink" title="Houston Texans Look to Improve Record in Division Play"></a>Houston Texans Look to Improve Record in Division Play</h1><p>The Houston Texans are coming off of a disappointing season that saw them finish 4-12 and in last place in the AFC South. They will look to improve their record in division play this season as they attempt to make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<p>Houston’s offense is led by quarterback Deshaun Watson, who is coming back from an ACL injury that cost him most of the 2017 season. Watson showed promise as a rookie in 2017, throwing for 1,699 yards and 19 touchdowns in just seven games. He will be looking to build on that success this season.</p>
<p>The Texans’ biggest strength lies on the defensive side of the ball. They have a number of talented players on defense, including J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney. The team finished third in the NFL in sacks last season with 50 and they will look to build on that success this year.</p>
<p>Houston is hopeful that they can improve their record in division play this season and make a run at the playoffs. They will have to contend with the Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Tennessee Titans in the AFC South, but there is no reason why they can’t compete with those teams.</p>
<h1 id="Keenum-Looks-to-Lead-Houston-Texans-to-Victory-Over-Indianapolis-Colts"><a href="#Keenum-Looks-to-Lead-Houston-Texans-to-Victory-Over-Indianapolis-Colts" class="headerlink" title="Keenum Looks to Lead Houston Texans to Victory Over Indianapolis Colts"></a>Keenum Looks to Lead Houston Texans to Victory Over Indianapolis Colts</h1><p>Houston Texans quarterback Case Keenum is looking to lead his team to victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Keenum has been a steady force for the Texans, and will need to be at his best against Andrew Luck and the Colts. The Texans have had a tough season, but Keenum has been a bright spot, throwing for 2,476 yards and 14 touchdowns. He will need to continue this level of play if the Texans are going to upset the Colts.</p>
<p>The Colts come into this game as the favorites, but they cannot take the Texans lightly. Houston has beaten Indianapolis in their last two meetings, and Keenum will be looking to make it three in a row. The Colts have struggled this season, and are coming off a disappointing loss to the New York Jets. If they want to make the playoffs, they need to start winning some games.</p>
<p>Luck is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and he will present a challenge for the Houston defense. The Texans have had trouble stopping opposing teams this season, and they will need to do better if they want to beat Indianapolis. The defensive line needs to get pressure on Luck, and the secondary needs to make sure that T.Y. Hilton is kept in check.</p>
<p>Houston has had a disappointing season, but there is still time for them to make a run at the playoffs. They need to win their final four games of the season, starting with Sunday’s matchup against Indianapolis. If Case Keenum can continue playing like he has been recently, there is no reason why they can’t win out.</p>
<h1 id="Watson-and-Johnson-Look-to-Take-Down-Jacksonville-Jaguars"><a href="#Watson-and-Johnson-Look-to-Take-Down-Jacksonville-Jaguars" class="headerlink" title="Watson and Johnson Look to Take Down Jacksonville Jaguars"></a>Watson and Johnson Look to Take Down Jacksonville Jaguars</h1><p>The Cleveland Browns’ coaching staff is under intense scrutiny this season after the team’s 0-16 record in 2017. However, there are some bright spots on the team, including rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield and defensive end Myles Garrett.</p>
<p>One such player who has flown under the radar is outside linebacker Jamie Collins. The former Pro Bowler Collins signed with the Browns in 2016 after four seasons with the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>Collins started off his career in Cleveland slow, but he has turned it around recently. He had nine tackles and a sack in last week’s win against the Atlanta Falcons. Now, Collins will have to face one of his old teams when the Browns take on the New England Patriots this Thursday night.</p>
<p>While Cleveland’s defense has been overshadowed by their offense this season, they have been playing better as of late. The Jaguars have one of the best offenses in the NFL, so this will be a good test for both sides.</p>
<p>If Collins and the Browns can come away with a win against Jacksonville, it would be a huge boost for them morale-wise and could give them some momentum heading into the second half of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Texans-Hope-to-Capitalize-on-Tennessee-Titans’-Struggles"><a href="#Houston-Texans-Hope-to-Capitalize-on-Tennessee-Titans’-Struggles" class="headerlink" title="Houston Texans Hope to Capitalize on Tennessee Titans’ Struggles"></a>Houston Texans Hope to Capitalize on Tennessee Titans’ Struggles</h1><p>This weekend, the Houston Texans will host the Tennessee Titans in a matchup of two AFC South foes. The Texans come into the game with a 3-3 record, while the Titans are just 2-4.</p>
<p>Houston has had some success against Tennessee in recent years. The Texans have won six of the last seven meetings against the Titans, including a 24-13 victory in Week 4 of last season.</p>
<p>The Texans hope to build off of that win on Sunday and pick up another victory over their divisional rival. Quarterback Deshaun Watson will be looking to continue his hot start to the season. Watson has thrown for 1,827 yards and 19 touchdowns in six games this year.</p>
<p>Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has also been one of Watson’s favorite targets. Hopkins leads the NFL with 793 receiving yards this season. He also has five touchdown receptions.</p>
<p>The Titans have had some struggles this year and will be looking to get back on track this weekend. Quarterback Marcus Mariota has thrown for just 1,056 yards and four touchdowns in six games this season.</p>
<p>Wide receiver Corey Davis is Mariota’s top target, as he has caught 27 passes for 365 yards and two touchdowns this year. running back Derrick Henry has also been a big part of Tennessee’s offense, rushing for 436 yards and four touchdowns on 91 carries this season.</p>
<p>The Texans are hoping to take advantage of the Titans’ struggles on Sunday and pick up a victory at home.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Houston-Texans-Clinch-the-AFC-South-with-a-Win-Over-the-Cincinnati-Bengals"><a href="#Can-Houston-Texans-Clinch-the-AFC-South-with-a-Win-Over-the-Cincinnati-Bengals" class="headerlink" title="Can Houston Texans Clinch the AFC South with a Win Over the Cincinnati Bengals?"></a>Can Houston Texans Clinch the AFC South with a Win Over the Cincinnati Bengals?</h1><p>Houston Texans (9-7)</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals (7-9)</p>
<p>The Houston Texans are looking to clinch the AFC South with a Week 17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. They currently lead the division by one game with a record of 9-7. The Bengals are also 7-9 and in need of a win to keep their playoff hopes alive. If Houston wins, they will clinch the AFC South and a playoff berth. If Cincinnati wins, they will take the lead in the AFC North and clinch a playoff berth.</p>
<p>Houston has had a roller coaster season, starting off 0-3 before winning nine of their next eleven games. The offense has been led by quarterback Deshaun Watson, who has thrown for 4,165 yards and 26 touchdowns this season. The running game has also been productive, with Lamar Miller rushing for 973 yards and five touchdowns. The defense has been inconsistent this season but is still ranked ninth in the league in points allowed per game.</p>
<p>The Bengals have had an up-and-down season as well,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> starting off 4-1 before losing eight of their next ten games. Their offense is led by quarterback Andy Dalton, who has thrown for 3,694 yards and 25 touchdowns this season. The running game is not as productive as Houston’s, with Joe Mixon leading the team with 883 yards and four touchdowns. The defense is ranked eleventh in points allowed per game but has struggled in recent weeks.</p>
<p>This matchup should be very competitive, with both teams fighting for a playoff berth. The Texans have the advantage at home but the Bengals will not go down easily. Expect a close game that comes down to the wire.</p>
