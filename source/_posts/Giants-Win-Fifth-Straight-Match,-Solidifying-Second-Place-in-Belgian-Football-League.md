#  Giants Win Fifth Straight Match, Solidifying Second Place in Belgian Football League

Ghent, Belgium - The Ghent Giants won their fifth consecutive game on Sunday, solidifying their position in second place in the Belgian Football League.

The Giants started quickly, scoring two goals in the first five minutes of the match. They continued to dominate possession and control the game throughout, eventually winning 3-0.

This win was especially important as it puts the Giants 11 points clear of third place, with just six games remaining in the season. This means they are all but assured a spot in the playoffs, where they will hope to challenge for the league title.

The Giants have now won seven of their last eight matches and seem to be hitting their stride at just the right time. Their next match is a huge clash against first place Club Brugge, who they are currently trailing by four points. A win in that match would put them in prime position to make a run at the title.

#  Giants Score Late to Earn Draw vs RSC Anderlecht

The New York Giants were looking for their first win of the preseason on Thursday night, but were forced to settle for a draw against RSC Anderlecht. The Belgian side took the lead in the second half, but the Giants scored late to earn a point.

It was a frustrating performance from the Giants, who struggled to create chances throughout the match. The best opportunity of the first half came in the form of a free kick from Odell Beckham Jr., but his effort was just wide of the target.

Beckham was at the heart of most of the Giants’ attacks and he came close to scoring on a number of occasions. However, it was not to be and he had to wait until injury time to make an impact.

With seconds remaining on the clock, Beckham was brought down in the area and quarterback Eli Manning stepped up to take the penalty. Manning made no mistake from the spot and levelled things up for his team.

It was a positive end to an otherwise disappointing game for the Giants, who will be aiming to get off the mark when they take on the Jets next week.

#  Late Penalty Saves Giants from Defeat Against Mouscron-Péruwelz

Belgium, Jupiler Pro League - In a game that seemed destined to end in defeat, the visiting Sint-Truiden Giants were saved by a late penalty in the 94th minute against Mouscron-Péruwelz.

The home side had taken the lead in the first half through a goal from Joseph Akpala and looked to be on their way to victory, but the Giants staged a remarkable comeback in the second half. Goals from Stef Van den Bogaert and Hamdi Harbaoui within two minutes of each other put the visitors ahead, only for Mouscron-Péruwelz to equalize through Ibrahima Balde in the 89th minute.

It looked as though both teams would have to settle for a point, until Giants defender Tom De Sutter was brought down in the area by Mouscron-Péruwelz goalkeeper Manuel Neuer in injury time. Harbaoui stepped up to take the resulting penalty and scored his second goal of the game to give Sint-Truiden all three points.

#  Antwerp Giants Lose to Club Brugge, Endangering Their Second Place Standing

The Antwerp Giants suffered a 3-2 loss to Club Brugge on Sunday, putting their second place standing in jeopardy. The Giants are now only two points ahead of Gent and four points ahead of third place Anderlecht.

It was a close game throughout, with Club Brugge opening the scoring in the eleventh minute and Antwerp tying it up just before halftime. In the second half, Club Brugge took the lead again, and then extended it to 3-1. Antwerp managed to score a last-minute goal, but it was not enough to pull out the win.

This was Antwerp’s first loss in six games and their first home loss of the season. They will now need to win their final two games of the season in order to clinch second place and a spot in next year’s UEFA Champions League qualification rounds.

The first of those games is scheduled for Wednesday night, when they will visit bottom-of-the-table Westerlo.

#  With 10 Matches Left, Antwerp Giants Must Fight Hard to Maintain Their League Position

The Antwerp Giants are in a precarious position in the Belgian League standings. Holding the seventh spot with just 10 games remaining, they cannot afford to lose any more ground if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive.

In their penultimate game of the season, the Giants will host Spirou Charleroi, who sit two spots and five games below them in the standings. A win for Antwerp would inch them closer to a postseason berth; however, a loss could be catastrophic.

Spirou have been inconsistent this season but have shown flashes of brilliance, which makes them a dangerous opponent for the Giants. In their previous matchup on January 21st, Antwerp narrowly edged out Spirou 92-90. With both teams hungry for a win, this rematch is sure to be exciting.

To stay in contention for the playoffs, Antwerp will need to rely on their star players: point guard Andrew Goudelock and swingman Quincy Miller. Goudelock is averaging over 20 points per game this season and has shown he can take over a game when necessary. Miller has been solid as well, averaging 14 points and 6 rebounds per contest.

Other players such as forward Dario Hunt and center Devin Ebanks will also need to contribute if Antwerp wants to come away with a win on Friday night. Hunt is averaging over 10 points and 9 rebounds per game while Ebanks provides scoring and defense off the bench.

It won’t be easy for the Giants to take down Spirou at home, but they are certainly capable of doing so. With their backs against the wall, Antwerp must fight hard to maintain their league position and earn a spot in the postseason.
