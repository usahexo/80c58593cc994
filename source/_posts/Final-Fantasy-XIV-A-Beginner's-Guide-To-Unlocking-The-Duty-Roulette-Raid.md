#  Final Fantasy XIV: A Beginner's Guide To Unlocking The Duty Roulette Raid

In order to access the Duty Roulette raid, you first need to unlock it by completing a number of duties. The first step is to complete the level 50 dungeon, The Stone Vigil. After doing so, speak with Ezrohir in The Pillars area of The Wolves' Den (X:9 Y:10). He will give you the quest "A World Unseen."

This quest will send you to three different areas - Costa del Sol, Western La Noscea, and Northern Thanalan - where you will need to speak with various NPCs in order to receive three items: a Deed of Covenant, a Token of Service, and a Mystic Binding. Once you have all three items, return back to Ezrohir and he will give you the quest "The Anomaly."

The final step is to complete The Anomaly by defeating King Behemoth at Indigo Point (X:15 Y:11) in Eastern La Noscea. Once King Behemoth has been defeated, return back to Ezrohir and he will give you the quest "Final Duty." This will unlock the Duty Roulette raid.

#  How To Do The Duty Roulette Raid In Final Fantasy XIV

Duty Roulette is a great way to get some extra experience and loot without having to put in too much effort. The raid version can be a bit tricky, though, so here’s a guide on how to do it.

First, make sure you have at least one tank and one healer in your group. The other eight members can be any combination of DPS and/or healers.

The next step is to determine the order in which you’ll be taking on the bosses. This can be done randomly or by assigning specific players to each role. If you’re using random order, have everyone roll a die (or use an online dice roller) and assign the numbers accordingly.

Once you have your order set, you can start the raid. The first thing you should do is take out the trash mobs near each boss. This will help reduce the amount of damage that gets dealt during the actual fight. Then, have the tanks take on the bosses while the DPS and healers focus on assisting them.

Be sure to use your cooldowns when necessary and pay attention to the healer’s mana bar so they don’t run out of juice prematurely. If everyone follows these guidelines, you should be able to beat the Duty Roulette raid with little or no trouble.
