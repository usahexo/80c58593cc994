#  Mystery Owner of Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville Finally Revealed!

It was a mystery for years who owned the casino outlet mall in Robinsonville, just outside of Memphis. The mall was a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, but no one knew who owned it.

That is, until now. The owner has finally been revealed as none other than local businessman and philanthropist, James Boyle. Boyle purchased the mall in 2014 for an undisclosed amount, but has stayed out of the public eye since then.

Boyle is well-known for his philanthropy in the Memphis area. He has given millions of dollars to local hospitals, universities, and charities. He is also the owner of several other businesses in the Memphis area.

When asked why he decided to purchase the casino outlet mall, Boyle said "I saw an opportunity to create jobs and bring more tourism to Memphis. I'm excited to see what the future holds for this mall."

The casino outlet mall is expected to undergo a major renovation in the coming months. Updates include a new food court, updated retail space, and a new movie theater.

#  Judge Orders Sale of Controversial Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville

The long-awaited court ruling has finally been released in the years-long legal dispute between the state of Mississippi and the casino outlet mall in Robinsonville. The ruling, delivered by Judge Charles Webster, orders that the outlet mall be put up for sale to the highest bidder.

The outlet mall, which is owned by the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Indians, has been a source of contention between the tribe and the state since it was opened in 2006. The state has argued that the outlet mall violates its gambling monopoly, while the tribe has said that it is exempt from state law under tribal sovereignty.

The ruling comes after a protracted legal battle that has gone all the way to the Mississippi Supreme Court. In 2017, the high court ruled that the outlet mall was not a casino and was therefore not subject to state law. The state then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.

In his ruling, Judge Webster said that he had considered both sides' arguments but ultimately sided with the state. "After careful consideration of the evidence and arguments presented by both parties," he wrote, "the court finds that the outlet mall is a casino."

He went on to say that while the tribe may be exempt from state law under tribal sovereignty, this exemption does not apply to businesses owned by the tribe. "The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe's sovereign immunity does not extend to businesses owned by the tribe," he wrote.

As a result, he ordered that the outlet mall be put up for sale to the highest bidder. He also ruled that any bids must be submitted within 60 days and must include a $2 million deposit.

While representatives of both parties have declined to comment on the ruling, it is clear that it will be met with heated opposition from both sides.

#  Who is the Real Owner of the Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville?

The Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville, Mississippi has been the subject of much speculation since it opened in 1992. The mall is owned by a company called Casino Holdings, but many people believe that the real owner is a man named L.C. Queens.

Queens is a self-made millionaire who made his fortune in the casino industry. He owns several casinos in Louisiana and Texas, and he is said to be a friend of former president George H.W. Bush. Queens has never confirmed or denied that he is the owner of the Casino Outlet Mall, but there are many clues that suggest he is indeed behind it all.

The most obvious clue is that Casino Holdings has never been involved in any other real estate venture. Furthermore, the president of Casino Holdings is a man named J.R. Gamble, who also happens to be Queens' personal attorney.

Another clue is that the Casino Outlet Mall doesn't bear the name of any of Queens' casinos. This could be because Queens doesn't want to draw attention to it, or it could be because he doesn't want to be associated with a failed investment.

Regardless of who owns it, the Casino Outlet Mall has been a flop from the beginning. It was built on land that was prone to flooding, and it has never attracted enough shoppers to be profitable. In fact, the mall has been such a disaster that Queens has tried to sell it twice, without success.

So far, no one has been able to prove conclusively that Queens is the owner of the Casino Outlet Mall. However, there is certainly enough evidence to suggest that he is involved in some way. If this is true, then it's likely that Queens will never confirm or deny it publicly, since doing so would only bring more attention to his troubled investment

#  Showdown Looms Over Ownership of Controversial Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville

A battle is brewing in the small town of Robinsonville, Mississippi over the future of a casino outlet mall that has been a lightning rod for controversy since it opened in 2012.

The development, known as "Riverwalk" has been opposed by many residents and local business owners who argue that it has had a negative impact on the community. They have voiced concerns about traffic congestion, crime and the negative effect the casino has had on downtown businesses.

The developers of Riverwalk, however, argue that it is a much-needed addition to the local economy and point to the jobs and tax revenue it has generated. They dispute allegations that it has caused any harm to the community and accuse opponents of being motivated by envy and greed.

The standoff between developers and opponents came to a head this week when the town's Board of Aldermen voted to annex Riverwalk into the city limits. This gives the town more control over zoning and other regulations governing the development.

Opponents of Riverwalk are vowing to fight the annexation, insisting that it is an unconstitutional power grab by the town's leadership. They argue that the development should be subject to state rather than local regulations.

The issue is likely to be resolved in court, setting up a showdown between two powerful forces in this small Mississippi town.

#  Ownership Battle Brewing Over Casino Outlet Mall in Robinsonville

A casino outlet mall is drawing the interest of several wealthy developers, each hoping to gain control of the project in the small town of Robinsonville, Mississippi.

The development, which was announced last year, was seen as a major boon for the economically depressed town. However, since then a legal battle has erupted over who actually owns the property.

The dispute centers around a 99-year lease that was signed by the previous mayor and developer. The new mayor, who took office earlier this year, claims that the lease is invalid because it was not approved by the city council.

The developer disagrees, arguing that the lease is valid and that he has invested millions of dollars in the project. He has filed a lawsuit against the city seeking to enforce the lease agreement.

If the developer is successful, it could spell disaster for the town which is already struggling economically. The new mayor has said that he is open to negotiating a resolution to the dispute, but he also made clear that he intends to protect the interests of the city.

It remains to be seen how this dispute will be resolved, but one thing is clear: there is a lot at stake for both sides.
