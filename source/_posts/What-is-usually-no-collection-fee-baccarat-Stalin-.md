#  Enjoy one of the most popular games around without having to worry about any collection fees!

 bowling is a hugely popular game, enjoyed by people of all ages all over the world. however, for some people, the cost of going to a bowling alley can be prohibitive – particularly if you want to go regularly.

fortunately, with some clever planning, you can enjoy this great game without having to worry about any collection fees! all you need is a few pieces of equipment and some space in your garden or backyard.

to start with, you’re going to need a set of ten pins. these can be bought very cheaply online or at your local sports store. Next, you’re going to need a ball – again, these can be picked up very cheaply and come in a variety of weights and sizes.

once you have your equipment, it’s time to find a space to set up your lane. ideally, you want an area that is around twenty-five feet long and six feet wide. if you don’t have access to a space like this, don’t worry – you can still enjoy bowling by setting up the pins at one end of the yard and rolling the ball from there.

now that you have your space sorted out, it’s time to set up the lane. starting at one end of your chosen space, place the pins in a triangular formation and make sure they are approximately two feet apart from each other. now, place the ball on the ground at the other end of the space and get ready to roll!

for those who are new to bowling, here are a few tips on how to score:




the objective of bowling is simple – knock over as many pins as possible with each throw. scoring is based on how many pins are knocked down with each throw and what type of throw it was (described below).



 counting starts when the ball first contacts the playing surface (usually the lane but sometimes also includes wood) and ends when either all 10 pins are cleared or control of the ball is lost (meaning it leaves the playing surface). if any pin(s) remain standing after the final ball has been thrown then they are counted as partof the score for that frame (maximum score per frame is 30 points).



  so what type of throws can you make? well, there are four types:

spare – knocking down all 10 pins with two balls; usually scores 10 points

strike – knocking down all 10 pins with one ball; usually scores 20 points

single – knocking down 1-3 pins with one ball; scores 3 points

double – knocking down 4-7 pins with one ball; scores 6 points
