#  What are the minimum and maximum bets?

In general, the minimum bet is the amount that can be wagered on a particular bet. The maximum bet is the largest wager that can be placed on a single bet or on a series of bets.

The minimum and maximum bets vary by casino, game, and table. They may also vary depending on the betting limits of the player. In most cases, the house sets the minimum and maximum bets.

Generally, the higher the minimum bet, the better for players. This is because it typically means that the casino has lower odds for games like blackjack and roulette. It also generally means that there is a wider range of betting options available at tables with higher minimums.

However, in some cases, casinos may set a minimum bet that is too high for some players. This can limit their ability to play certain games orbet on certain outcomes.

#  What is the RTP? 

The RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is a networking protocol used for transmitting real-time data, such as audio and video. It is used in applications such as streaming media and telephony.

The RTP was designed to be lossless, meaning that no data is lost during transmission. This makes it suitable for applications such as streaming audio and video, where any lost data would be noticeable to the user.

The RTP is also congestion-aware, meaning that it adjusts its transmission rate according to the current network conditions. This helps to ensure that the network does not become overloaded, which could lead to degraded performance or even failure.

The RTP is a packet-based protocol, meaning that each piece of data is sent in a separate packet. This helps to improve reliability, as packets can be re-sent if they are lost or delayed.

The RTP protocol is defined in RFC 3550.

#  Are there any bonus rounds?

The short answer is yes, there are potential bonus rounds in slots games but they’re not guaranteed. Bonus rounds typically come in the form of free games or prize multipliers. Look out for games that have a special symbol that activates the bonus round – usually it’s a designated symbol like a star, diamond or bell.

Your chances of triggering the bonus round increase when you bet more money per spin. Make sure to check the game rules before playing so that you know what symbols are associated with the bonus round and how to activate it.
