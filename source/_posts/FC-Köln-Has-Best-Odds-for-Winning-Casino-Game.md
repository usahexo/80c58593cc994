# FC Köln Has Best Odds for Winning Casino Game

Football Club Köln is coming off of a spectacular season in 2016-2017 Bundesliga campaign. The team finished 5th in the league and qualified for the Europa League. This preseason, they have been one of the busier sides in Europe, making several signings to improve their squad. One of these new signings, defender Jannes Horn, seems to have adapted well to the club and has given them a much-needed boost on defense.

However, their biggest challenge this season might not be on the pitch but in the casino. That’s because FC Köln has the best odds to win the casino game. Here are three reasons why:

1) They’ve Got Depth at Every Position

Depth is key in any sport, but especially so in casino games where injuries can easily occur. FC Köln has plenty of depth at every position, which will come in handy during the long season. Up front, they have Polish striker Lukasz Podolski, who was one of the top scorers in the Bundesliga last season. They also have young Brazilian talent Malcolm Cacuttinga, who had a breakout year last season with 8 goals and 6 assists in 26 appearances. At midfield, they have players like Matthias Lehmann and Jung Sung Ryong who can both provide solid defensive coverage while also being able to contribute offensively when needed. And finally, at goalkeeper they have Timo Horn who is one of the best keepers in Germany and has been linked with several big clubs over the past few seasons.

2) They’ve Got a Strong Defense

FC Köln also has a strong defense that will be difficult for opposing teams to break down. In addition to Jannes Horn, they have other talented defenders like Dominic Maroh, Jonas Hector, and Mergim Mavraj who all had excellent seasons last year. This back line will be crucial in protecting their lead late in games or preserving a tie on away soil.

3) They’re Ready to Bounce Back from Struggles Last Season

Last season wasn’t ideal for FC Köln as they struggled to find consistent form and ended up finishing just outside of European qualification spots. However, this preseason they’ve looked much better and seem ready to bounce back from their struggles last season. With a mix of young talent and experienced veterans, this team looks poised for a great season and could very well end up winning the casino game.
