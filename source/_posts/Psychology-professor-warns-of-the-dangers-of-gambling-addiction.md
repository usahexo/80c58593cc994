#  Psychology professor warns of the dangers of gambling addiction

In a recent interview with a local news station, Psychology professor Dr. Jameson cautioned parents about the dangers of gambling addiction. "Gambling addiction is a serious problem," Dr. Jameson said. "It can ruin lives and families."

Dr. Jameson noted that many people don't realize they're addicted to gambling until it's too late. "Addicts often try to rationalize their behavior," he said, "telling themselves that they're just having fun or that they can afford to lose money. But the truth is, gambling addiction is a serious mental illness that can completely destroy lives."

Dr. Jameson urged parents to talk to their kids about the dangers of gambling addiction and to closely monitor their children's activities online and in casinos. "If you think your child might be addicted to gambling, please seek help immediately," he said. "The longer you wait, the worse the problem will become."

#  Gambling poses fiscal risks to governments and taxpayers

## Gambling can have serious negative fiscal consequences for governments and taxpayers.

When gambling is conducted in a legal and regulated environment, the government can earn tax revenue from operators and players. However, when gambling is conducted in an illegal or unregulated environment, the government may lose tax revenue and incur other costs, such as law enforcement costs. In addition, problem gambling can lead to increased public assistance and health care costs.

Gambling activities can have a range of negative fiscal consequences for governments and taxpayers. These consequences include: lost tax revenue; increased law enforcement and criminal justice costs; increased social welfare and health care costs; and damage to the economy.

Lost tax revenue

Gambling can result in a loss of tax revenue for governments. This occurs when people gamble instead of paying taxes on their income, or when gambling businesses do not pay taxes on their profits. For example, in Australia it is estimated that the illegal gambling market cost the government more than $600 million in lost tax revenue in 2009-10[i]. In the United States, it is estimated that $40 billion is lost each year in uncollected taxes from gambling businesses[ii].

Increased law enforcement and criminal justice costs

Gambling can also lead to increased law enforcement and criminal justice costs. This occurs when people gamble illegally or when there are problems with gambling (e.g., fraud, money laundering, etc.). For example, in the United Kingdom it has been estimated that the cost of crime associated with gambling was £1.2 billion in 2010-11[iii]. In Australia, it has been estimated that the cost of law enforcement associated with illegal gambling was $260 million in 2009-10[iv].

Increased social welfare and health care costs

Gambling can also lead to increased social welfare and health care costs. This occurs when people have problems with their gambling behaviour (e.g., become addicted to gambling) and require assistance from social welfare or health services. For example, it has been estimated that problem gamblers account for 58% of all spending on problem gambling services[v]. In Australia it has been estimated that the social welfare cost of problem gambling was $1.04 billion in 2009-10[vi]. It has also been estimated that the annual health care cost of treating problem gamblers was $35 million in 2009-10[vii].

#  Is gambling a risk worth taking?

Images of people winning big at casinos often come to mind when one thinks about gambling. Indeed, for some people gambling can be exciting and thrilling, providing the potential for great payouts. However, there is also risk involved in gambling, which is why some people may wonder if it is a risk worth taking.

To answer this question, it is helpful to first understand what gambling entails. Gambling generally refers to any activity where there is an element of chance or luck involved in determining the outcome. This can include activities like betting on sports or playing cards, but can also extend to more high-stakes pursuits such as investing in stocks or playing the lottery.

So, is gambling a risk worth taking? The answer to this question depends on individual circumstances. For some people, the potential rewards may be worth the risk, while others may find that the risks are too high for their liking. It is important to weigh all the factors relevant to your own situation before deciding whether or not gambling is right for you.

#  Study finds majority of Americans believe gambling is too risky

A recent study by the University of Massachusetts found that two-thirds of Americans believe gambling is too risky. This is a significant increase from 2004 when only half of Americans felt the same way.

The study also found that people who live in states with lotteries are more likely to believe gambling is too risky than those who don't. In fact, 82% of people living in lottery states think gambling is too risky, compared to 60% of those living in non-lottery states.

Researchers believe the increase in the number of Americans who believe gambling is too risky is due, in part, to the increasing popularity of state-sponsored lotteries. In addition, the financial crisis of 2008 may have also played a role, as it made people more cautious about spending money on anything considered risky.

Despite this trend, gambling remains popular in the United States. In fact, Americans spend more than $100 billion on gambling each year.

#  Researchers develop new tool to assess risk in gambling

A new risk assessment tool has been developed by researchers in order to help identify people who are at risk of developing gambling problems. The tool, which is called the CRAFFT questionnaire, was designed to be used with young people and takes into account a number of different factors that may increase the risk of developing a gambling problem.

The questionnaire consists of six questions that ask about a person’s alcohol and drug use, as well as their gambling behaviour. It is hoped that by using the CRAFFT questionnaire, health professionals will be better able to identify those who are at risk and provide them with the necessary support and treatment.

According to the researchers, one in four people who gamble will develop a problem with gambling. This is a significant number, and it is therefore important that measures are taken to help reduce this number. The CRAFFT questionnaire is just one of the tools that can be used to achieve this goal.

The questionnaire was developed following a review of over 60 different studies on gambling behaviour. The aim of the review was to identify the factors that are most commonly associated with problem gambling. The results of the review showed that alcohol and drug use, as well as impulsivity, were all linked with an increased risk of developing a gambling problem.

The CRAFFT questionnaire was then tested on over 2,000 young people in the US. The results showed that it was able to accurately identify those who were at risk of developing a problem gambler.

So far, the CRAFFT questionnaire has only been tested on young people in the US; however, it is likely that it could be used elsewhere in the world. Gambling problems are not just limited to young people in the US; they can affect people from all age groups.

The development of the CRAFFT questionnaire is a positive step forward in helping to reduce the number of people who develop a problem gambler. It is hoped that health professionals will begin using this tool in order to identify those who are at risk and provide them with the necessary treatment and support.
