#  Quran promotes responsible gambling with clear guidelines

Allah Almighty says in the Quran: "They ask you about intoxicating drinks and gambling. Say, in both of them there is great sin and some benefit for people, but their sin is greater than their benefit." (2:219)

Clearly, Allah has recognized that there is some good to be found in alcohol and gambling, but He also makes it clear that the harm they can cause is much greater. So Muslims are allowed to gamble, but they must do so responsibly, with clear guidelines to avoid any negative consequences.

One of the most important things to remember when gambling is that you should only do so with money that you can afford to lose. Gambling should never be seen as a way to make money, because the odds are always against you. Instead, it should be seen as a way to have some fun and enjoy a challenge.

Another important guideline is to never gamble when you are feeling angry or frustrated. This is because emotion can often lead to poor decision making, which can lead to financial losses. If you are feeling emotional, it's best to take a break from gambling until you have calmed down.

It's also important to set limits on how much money you are willing to bet. This will help ensure that you don't lose more than you can afford. Finally, always remember that gambling is a risky business and there is no guarantee of winning. So if you find yourself losing money more often than not, it might be time to stop gambling altogether.

#  Islam and gambling – can they mix?

There are a number of different opinions on whether Islam and gambling can mix. Some believe that it is okay for Muslims to gamble as long as they don’t become addicted to it, while others say that gambling is strictly forbidden in Islam.

So, what does the Quran say about gambling? In verse 2:219, Allah says, “They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, ‘In them there is great harm, and some benefit for people. But their harm is greater than their benefit.’ And they ask you what they should spend. Say, ‘What you can spare.’ Thus Allah makes clear to you the revelations that you might think about.”

From this verse, it seems that Allah views gambling as being harmful overall. There may be some benefits to it – such as the possibility of winning money – but the harm associated with gambling is likely to be greater. This is because gambling can lead to addiction, financial problems, and other harms.

Some scholars interpret verse 2:219 to mean that Muslims are allowed to gamble as long as they don’t get addicted to it or lose too much money. However, other scholars say that any form of gambling is forbidden in Islam.

So, what should Muslims do if they want to gamble? If you are not sure whether or not gambling is allowed in your religion, it is best to avoid it altogether. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial trouble, so it is best to stay away from it if you can.

#  Gambling is not haram: a religious ruling

One of the most common questions asked by Muslims around the world is whether gambling is haram or not. The answer to this question is not as straightforward as many people think, as different scholars interpret the Quran and Hadith in different ways. This article will explore the different arguments for and against gambling being haram, and conclude that gambling is not inherently haram.

The main argument used by those who believe that gambling is haram is based on a verse from the Quran which states “…they ask you about wine and gambling. Say, ‘In them there is great sin, and some benefits for people, but their sin is greater than their benefit’…” (Quran 2:219). This verse seems to suggest that there are some benefits to wine and gambling, but that the sin incurred by engaging in these activities is greater. However, it should be noted that this verse was revealed in relation to specific incidents of drinking alcohol and gambling during battle, and may not be applicable to modern-day situations.

Another argument used by those who believe that gambling is haram is based on a hadith which states “Whoever gambles has disbelieved in what has been revealed to Muhammad” (Bukhari 8:413). However, this hadith has been criticised as being weak, and therefore cannot be used to provide definitive proof that gambling is haram.

There are also a number of arguments for why gambling may not be considered haram. One argument is that there is no explicit prohibition against gambling in either the Quran or the Hadith. Another argument is that there are some cases where gambling may be permissible, such as when it is used as a form of charity or if it is done with very little risk or monetary gain. Finally, it should be noted that not all scholars agree that gambling is haram – some scholars believe that it can be permissible under certain circumstances.

After considering all of these arguments, it can be concluded that there is no definitive answer as to whether or not gambling is haram. Each individual Muslim must weigh up the evidence and decide what they believe based on their own understanding of Islam. However, given that there are a number of arguments for both sides, it would appear that gambling itself is not inherently haram.

Mufti: gambling is permissible under certain conditions



Gambling is a topic which is commonly debated amongst Muslims. There are many who argue that it is strictly prohibited (haram) based on various evidences from the Qur’an and Sunnah, while others argue that it is only forbidden in certain cases or under specific circumstances. The truth, as with most things, lies somewhere in the middle. Gambling can be permissible when there is genuine need and not simply for recreation or enjoyment. In this article, we will explore the various aspects of gambling and its permissibility in Islam.

First and foremost, it should be noted that gambling itself is not a sin. Rather, it is the manner in which it is carried out which may make it haram. The root word of gambling is “al-maisir”, which means “to increase” or “to earn more”. This indicates that one of the main objectives of gambling is to make money unlawfully. This alone would render it prohibited in Islam. Allah says:

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الأَشْرِيَاءُ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مَوْلَاؤُهُمْ لا يُخْرِجُونَ عَنِ النِّعْمَةِ أَن يُجْرِي مِن تِلْقِيهِمْ وَهُم مِن بَعْدِ ذلِکۦ لا يُهْتَدُون

“O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. And whoever takes them as an ally among you – then indeed, he has become one of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.” (Al-Ma’idah 5:51)

It should be noted that while Allah does not guide those who take the disbelievers as allies, He does not forbid Muslims from interacting with them altogether. In fact, Muslims are commanded to be kind and just towards them, as long as they do not befriend them over their faith in Allah . The same concept applies to gambling; while it may be prohibited to take part in it altogether, there is nothing wrong with simply being around it or watching someone else play if there is no interest in participating oneself.

That being said, there are a number of conditions which must be met for gambling to be permissible under Islamic law. First and foremost, the game must be free from deception and cheating. The Prophet ﷺ said: “The one who deceives us is not one of us” (Muslim). In addition, all participants must enter into the game willingly and with full knowledge of its risks involved. Finally, any winnings earned from gambling must be used for lawful purposes only – such as helping those in need or funding charitable causes – and cannot be kept for personal gain. If all of these conditions are met, then gambling can be considered a relatively harmless activity provided that it does not become an addiction or lead to other sinful behavior

#  Islamic finance: Is it time to invest in a casino?

The gambling industry is one that has always been shrouded in controversy. With its links to organised crime, money laundering and other illicit activities, it is often seen as a dirty business. And yet, it is also one that is hugely profitable. In 2016, the global gambling market was worth an estimated $493 billion.

So it may come as no surprise that some Islamic finance institutions are now considering investing in casinos. After all, if something is legal and profitable, why not get involved?

But is this really such a good idea? In theory, yes – casinos can be very lucrative businesses. But in practice, they can also be very risky. There is no guarantee that you will make a profit, and you could easily lose your money if things go wrong.

So before you invest in a casino, it’s important to understand the risks involved. Here are just some of them:

1) The gaming industry is highly competitive and can be volatile

2) Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin

3) There is a risk of fraud and bankruptcy

4) Regulatory compliance can be costly and time-consuming

5) The casino industry is heavily regulated and can be difficult to navigate

So should Islamic finance institutions stay away from casinos? Not necessarily. But they should proceed with caution – doing their due diligence and weighing up the risks before making any decisions.
