#  What is the net worth of Paris Saint-Germain F.C.?

As of June 2017, Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s net worth was estimated to be $1.16 billion. This was up from their previous estimate of $856 million in 2016. This increase is largely due to their recent takeover by Qatar Sports Investments, which has injected a great deal of money into the club.

Qatar Sports Investments is a state-owned investment firm that is controlled by the government of Qatar. It was founded in 2006 with the goal of investing in sport teams and properties around the world. In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., they are also the owners of Spanish club Real Madrid and English club Manchester City.

Since purchasing Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Qatar Sports Investments has been pumping money into the team in an attempt to make them one of the top clubs in Europe. In addition to increased wages for the players, they have also renovated the team's stadium and brought in some of the best players in the world, such as Neymar Jr., Edinson Cavani, and Kylian Mbappé.

The increased spending by Qatar Sports Investments has resulted in some financial losses for the club. However, these losses are likely seen as a long-term investment by the owners, as they hope to make Paris Saint-Germain F.C. one of the biggest clubs in Europe.

#  How many championships has Paris Saint-Germain F.C. won?

Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, also known simply as Paris Saint-Germain (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi sɛ̃ ɡʁɛmɑ̃]), is a French professional football club based in the city of Paris. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG are the most successful club in French football, with 42 league titles, 27 Coupe de France wins, and 10 Coupe de la Ligue trophies.

The club has also won six Ligue 1 Cups, a record five UEFA Trophies (including three UEFA Champions League titles), and one Intercontinental Cup. With their first professional trophy in 1974, they became the first team from outside of Spain to win the Copa del Rey. They also reached the semi-finals of the 1994–95 European Cup, as well as the semi-finals of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. In domestic football, they have won all four major competitions – Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions – on two occasions each: 1988–89 and 2016–17.

In terms of individual honours, many players have won numerous awards while playing for PSG. Zlatan Ibrahimović is the club's all-time top goalscorer with 156 goals in 180 competitive matches between 2012 and 2016. He is also one of only five players to have won 12 different domestic/international trophies since 2007 (the others being Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Gerard Piqué). Brazilian forward Neymar is currently the most expensive player in history after his €222 million (£200 million) transfer from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in August 2017.
