#  How to Win at Soft Total in Baccarat Myanmar 

The goal of the game is to win more points than the dealer without going over 21. The player and dealer are each given two cards. Points are tallied as follows:

• Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) = 10 points each
• Number cards (2-10) = face value
• An Ace = 1 point or 11 points, whichever is preferable to the player 

If the player’s first card is an Ace and the second card is a 6, the player would have 7 points. However, if the player chose to count the Ace as 1 point instead of 11 points, then the player would have 6 points. In either case, the player has not gone over 21 and wins since they have more points than the dealer. In order words, when both players have two cards in their hand; 

Player's hand > Dealer's hand ----> Player Win 
Player's hand < Dealer's hand ----> Dealer Win

#  What is a Soft Total in Baccarat Myanmar? 

In the game of Baccarat, known as the banker's game, a soft total is a hand totaling six or seven that includes an ace counted as 1. A soft total is any hand with an ace valued at 1. 

When you are playing baccarat and receive a 6 or 7 with an Ace, this is referred to as a soft total. The Ace in this instance is worth 1 point, so the hand would be 6 or 7 points in total. This designation matters when it comes time to take action on the hand - specifically, whether to hit or stand. 

If the player has a soft 12-16, they should hit because the Ace makes them less likely to bust; conversely, if the player has a soft 18-21, they should stand because the Ace makes their total potential points more dangerous.

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world. There are many different ways to play the game, but the most common is the banker, player, and tie bets. In this article, we will discuss how to play soft total in Baccarat Myanmar.

A soft total is a hand that includes an Ace and any number other than a 1. When playing soft totals in Baccarat Myanmar, you want to make a simple bet on the banker or player. You should also make an additional bet on the tie if you want to cover that possibility.

If your first two cards are an Ace and a number other than 1, then you have a soft total of 2. To calculate your winnings on this hand, simply add the value of your Ace and the number on your other card. So, if you were playing with two 6s as your first two cards (a soft 12), your winnings would be 12 units.

If you have two cards of the same value (e.g. two 3s), then your total is not considered a soft total and you would use standard rules for baccarat to determine your winnings.
